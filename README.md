# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for 94-470 at CMU! 
# About Me
My name is Yucheng. I am enrolled in the BS/MS program at EPP and am currently a senior undergraduate double majoring in Chemistry and Environmental Sustainability Studies. I focused on the science and engineering behind environmental issues and risk analysis. 
# What I want to learn
I wish to find a way to best communicate between interdisciplinary communities with clear data visualization. I wish to learn the magic of visualizing data that can lead people to read and interpret.
