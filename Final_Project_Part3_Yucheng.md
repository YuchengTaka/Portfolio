# Changes made since Part II
From part II, I received a lot of constructing advice and critiques about the content and format of my delivery. As for the content, I upgraded the stacked bar graph into a area graph that better illustrate the changes in music industry through out the past decades. Here is the updated graph I made using tableau. 

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1709373805120' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='The shift in total revenue made by different forms of music ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mu&#47;MusicRevenue_17091433062410&#47;Sheet8&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='MusicRevenue_17091433062410&#47;Sheet8' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mu&#47;MusicRevenue_17091433062410&#47;Sheet8&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>     

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
 var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1709373805120');                    
 var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
 var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
 scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);
