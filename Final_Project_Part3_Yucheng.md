# The final data story
> [This is my shorthand for my final project](https://preview.shorthand.com/2LYrpiANUbefEVDL)

This shorthand slide delivers a story to the audience about the hidden cost of music streaming in carbon burden around the globe, engaging the audience into making changes in music streaming that promote a better sustainable future, upgrading the music industry. I tell my audience about the changes in music industry in the last four to five decades and showcase the result: the dominance of streaming. I then showcase them about the total revenue make up and carbon footprint make up in 2019 to better illustrate that streaming contributes the most to modern society and call for actions for people to address such carbon burden. 


# Summary of Changes made since Part II and Final design decisions
From part II, I received a lot of constructive advice and critiques about the content and format of my delivery. As for the content, I upgraded the stacked bar graph into an area graph that better illustrates the changes in the music industry throughout the past decades. Here is the updated graph I made using Tableau. I decided to use yellow and red color to represent modern forms of digital music. I choose to use these color because I learnt that color conveys emotion and attract attention, the color schemes works well in attracting attention and also works well in indicating my implication that people should be warn or informed of the potential environmental damage of digital streaming. 

<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1709373805120' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='The shift in total revenue made by different forms of music ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mu&#47;MusicRevenue_17091433062410&#47;Sheet8&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='MusicRevenue_17091433062410&#47;Sheet8' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Mu&#47;MusicRevenue_17091433062410&#47;Sheet8&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>     

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
 var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1709373805120');                    
 var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    
 vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
 var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
 scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    
 vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

I also create a better shorthand with my storyline of delivery. I start the audience's journey with a showcase of the changes in music histories to make people understand the speed of increasing digital forms and the decrease in traditional physical music. I also made visualizations using Tableau to showcase the carbon footprint contributor distribution to back up my idea that streaming nowadays generates the most carbon footprint among all the other music forms. I updated the shorthand with the figures with the distribution of music industry revenue in 2019 and the underlying carbon footprint for 2019. The figure shows a total dominance of music streaming both in the sales but also in the carbon burden it delivered to Earth. I also choose to use blue color for music streaming and download and use a contrast red for physical copies of music to create the separation and difference between these two forms of music. The carbon footprint figure utilized a light pink color to distinct from all the other sections and the reason I did not use red is that Red is too bright and would cause eye-fatigue and irritation in a pie chart, and pink also showcases the feeling of warmth to help me illustration that streaming is the No.1 global warming CO2 contributor in the music industry after 2019

To sum up, the feedback from part 2 and also after the presentation helps me rethink the relationship between me and my audience and helps me make better decisions in choosing data visualization and telling the story in a more approachable and engaging manner.

To sum up, the feedback from part 2 and also after the presentation helps me rethink the relationship between me and my audience and helps me make better decisions in choosing data visualization and telling the story in a more approachable and engaging manner. 

## The audience
My audience remains the general public but after getting feedback from the interview and from Professor and TA. I rethought my approach to delivering and thinking about how to make people engaged in my study. I change the title to Listening to Carbon Footprint to give my audience a hint of music and environmental-related topics. I also wish to use simple language and good data visualization to deliver my specialty in Environmental Studies and Music Performances background. I think the presentation works well in showcasing the story behind the carbon footprint of music streaming.

# Final thoughts
I think the overall structure of this mini is very reasonable and the instructors offer a lot of flexibility for students to plan their schedule and the feedback from you guys is always timely and helpful. Thank you again for this amazing semester. 
The things I wish to improve are thinking about a topic and starting digging for the dataset earlier, it would make the process much easier because dealing with data and cleaning it usually takes a lot of time. After cleaning and preparing the data, one would have more time to design them in tableau and apply the good practices we learned from discussions, lectures, previous assignments, and in-class activities. I feel that I could be more decisive in finding a good way to represent the analysis of data than before, I also found that I am more adaptable in choosing color schemes to deliver emotion and implications within data visualization. Overall, even though I have been dealing with data for some time, I found myself new to data analysis when I started learning this course, and throughout these days of learning and practicing I am more confident in dealing with data, I wish I could use the knowledge I learned from this course to deliver better data analysis in my future academic life and career.
