# FINAL PROJECT

Here is my final project part I! Here is the link to the main portfolio: https://yuchengtaka.github.io/Portfolio/

# Topic: Analyzing the Environmental Footprint of Digital Entertainment
## Introduction

In an era where digital consumption is as normal as drinking and breathing, the environmental impact of our online activities remains a largely untold story, especially in digital entertainment. As a chemistry, engineering, and public policy student with a deep passion for music, I want to explore this critical issue. The intersection of these fields offers a fresh lens through which to examine the carbon footprint and environmental effects of music streaming. This project isn't just about quantifying energy consumption or emissions; it's about unveiling the hidden costs of our digital appetites. It is more about informing people about the hidden costs they are generating or paying to boost future sustainable digital consumption. The story I am about to tell matters because it addresses an urgent yet overlooked aspect of our environmental footprint, offering insights and pathways toward more sustainable practices in our increasingly digital world.


# Summary

This project aims to uncover the environmental impact of this digital consumption mainly focused on music streaming. While these platforms offer music at high convenience and high variety, they also consume significant amounts of energy, contributing to carbon emissions and electronic waste. Through this exploration, I intend to highlight the hidden costs of our digital entertainment habits and explore potential strategies for reducing their environmental footprint. This investigation is out of my academic interest, and hopefully, it could deliver a story that calls to action for consumers, producers, and policymakers to consider more sustainable practices in the digital entertainment industry.

# Background
The transition from physical to digital formats in music has been one of the most significant shifts in the entertainment industry over the past few decades. Initially, music was consumed through physical media like vinyl records, cassettes, and CDs. Energy consumption, carbon emissions, and electronic waste are following the boost of platforms like Spotify.  Streaming music requires significant data center resources, which consume vast amounts of electricity, much of which is generated from non-renewable sources. 

# What I want to achieve after informing the audience
At first, I anticipated that the attention would be drawn and interest raised for the audience because listening to music is quite universal and popular so people related to this topic. As they proceed through this project, they would feel sad and concerned for the are now aware that the electricity and other resources it took for a hit song on the internet are costly and environmental unfriendly, the curve is low at the point and then I would show them what are the science world is doing to fix these issue and provide some future directions based on the trend I showed to them on the digital and physical world of music. At this point, the audience might be a bit relieved and  emotionally intake the story. 

# Data Collection and Methods
To understand the environmental impact of digital entertainment, this project will utilize data from various sources, including industry reports from entities like the International Energy Agency and Spotify, online databases, and academic studies from journals focusing on environmental science and technology in music. This comprehensive approach will provide a broad overview of the energy and resource demands of digital entertainment.

Analytical Approach
The project will employ a mixed-methods approach to analyze the environmental footprint of streaming music. Quantitative data on energy consumption, carbon emissions, and e-waste generation will be analyzed to draw comparisons between digital and physical formats. 

Visualization Type: Bar Charts or Comparative Line Graphs

I wish to compare the energy consumption of music streaming services with physical music production and sales proportion or market situation in music.
Use bar charts to represent total energy consumption or total sales side by side for digital and physical formats. For a dynamic comparison over time, line graphs can illustrate trends in energy consumption as both industries evolve. I would give you initial sketches to illustrate it better

# Initial Sketches
The stacked bar graph on the # of sales of physical music vs Digital Music

I hope to illustrate the share of each major form of music in the market each year and horizontally comparable with each other. The y-axis is sales and the x-axis is the years. It would be interesting to see each years composition changing under the changes in popularity of digital streaming platforms

The line graph about the carbon footprint of physical copy of music and digital streams is generating and their trend by years

The visualization aims to give the audience an idea of the footprint both forms of music is generating. I hope this could provide informations and ideas of the environmental impact by selling music.

# Methods and Medium

In this project, I would use Tableau for accurate and suitable visualization and shorthand to boost my storytelling to further generate and explain the desired line graph and stacked bar graph using the data.  I would use GitHub to do hosting and sharing which serves as the central hub for the project, hosting the Shorthand narrative, Tableau visualizations embedded within the story, and any additional resources or documentation related to the project.
