# Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
Here is my Critique by Design with Tableau assignment!
Here is the link to the main portfolio: https://yuchengtaka.github.io/Portfolio/
# Step One - Finding the data 
Here is the link to the database. https://makeovermonday.co.uk/
Among all of these data, I chose the one that discussed different brands of electronic vehicles's share in the market in different quarters. This is the link to the data visualization that I will be conducting a critique on. https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-electric-vehicle-market-share/
The data was obtained in the following link:

# Observation and complete the Google Form
The data visualization Google form is very useful, here are some takeaways and a summary of what I submitted. 
The original data visualization highlights market leaders using color coding but didn't do well in clarity due to its confusing color scheme and ineffective use of a stacked bar chart, making it difficult to distinguish between brands and compare their market shares across quarters. To improve, I would like to reorder the stacked bars and adopt line and pie charts for a clearer representation of market trends, focusing on major brands like Volkswagen, BYD, and Tesla for a comprehensive market overview because they are from Europe, the US, and China. This visualization is aimed at marketing managers and investors, who require accurate and accessible data to inform strategic decisions and investment allocations in the automotive sector.

This is the original data visualization:

# Sketch Out a Solution 
Here are some of my sketches about the Global Electronic Vehicle. 
For this Bar graph, I use Blue for Volkswagen, Red for Tesla and Yellow for BYD, I also place the major share leader on the top of the bar.

Here is the line graph I plotted with the same color scheme. The x-axis is the Quarters and the y-axis is the percentage.

Here is the Pie Chart I created follow the same color scheme and representing only one of the quarters.

# Test Out the Solution
I conducted three short interviews to ask people for their feedback on my redesigned and newly created data visualization on global market share of electronic vehicles. The questions for them mainly focused on their intuitive first-look understanding of the data, some interpretation of the audience, and suggestions for changes. 

22 Female Student

- what do you think this is?

"I think they all show the market share of Tesla, BYD, and Volkswagen in global e-vehicle"

- Would you describe to me what this is telling you?

"Tesla has always been doing well until recently getting surpassed by BYD. Volkswagen is not comparable with these two big leaders
  BYD's been growing fast"
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

"The sequence of the sections in the bar chart is not consistent. I think a parallel comparison would be a good alternative. The line and pie graph are generally clear, at least to me"
- Who is the intended audience for this, in your opinion?

"People that are interested or planning to buy an e-vehicle? This tells me which brand is more popular and there must be a reason behind the popularity "
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
There is some differences in the color assignment indicator on the right of all of your graphs, in the line chart it was a red dot and red Tesla Text, Orange dot for BYD and orange Text for BYD, maybe u should change the other text into their corresponding color"

51 Male Engineer

- what do you think this is?

"They are graphs about global e-car market share and they have different intentions. "
- Would you describe to me what this is telling you?

"The pie chart tells me which car sells the most in a quarter, the line chart tells me the changes in market share across different Quarters. The bar chart is like a table to me" He then explains "They are just their percentage numbers in a colorful box, a colorful table! "

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

"I am surprised on how better the line chart works in informing me about the situation in the global market, for I could access their percentage and I could see changes over time "
- Who is the intended audience for this, in your opinion?

"Probably people that invest stocks need to know which companies are doing better than the others, and also an opportunity to invest in weaker competitors, it's like seeing potentials, for example, Volkswagen are the manufacture that has its own culture and history, by seeing this trend u have to be sensitive to these numbers and be visionary. "

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

"If I were you I would get rid of the bar graph"

## Brief Summary of the feedback
The overall feedback was positive. They both express some confusion about the bar graph, and they both like the line graph because of the obvious infor about the changes across quarters. They suggested that I should use more consistent text color along with the color scheme I had for the data viz. There are some differences in the intended audience. It is reasonable to be concerned the difference in their need and financial management directions. 

I learned that I should focus more on the line graph make sure to conclude the major three companies that I am comparing, and use the right color scheme. 

# Step Five: Build My Solution
Here is my line graph:
I exclude all the other data besides Tesla, BYD, and Volkswagon. From this visualization, we could tell the strong increase of the BYD auto in these quarters, we could see the rather stable situation with Tesla with a minor decrease in the market share. We could also tell the drop of Volkswagen's market share under the influence of BYD's robust growth and Tesla's stable share I set the y-axis to be the percentage of sharing and the x-axis to be the quarters according to time. I updated my final visualization with the annotated percentage of sharing of a brand for the audience to compare vertically within a certain quarter and have trends available for people to compare horizontally. The line graph serves as a good visualization method that gives information about the difference between brands themselves and the overall changes throughout the years.
