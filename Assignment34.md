# Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)
Here is my Critique by Design with Tableau assignment!

# Step One - Finding the data 
Here is the link to the database. https://makeovermonday.co.uk/
Among all of these data, I chose the one that discussed different brands of electronic vehicles's share in the market in different quarters. This is the link to the data visualization that I will be conducting a critique on. https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/global-electric-vehicle-market-share/
The data was obtained in the following link:

# Observation and complete the Google Form
The data visualization Google form is very useful, here are some takeaways and a summary of what I submitted. 
The original data visualization highlights market leaders using color coding but didn't do well in clarity due to its confusing color scheme and ineffective use of a stacked bar chart, making it difficult to distinguish between brands and compare their market shares across quarters. To improve, I would like to reorder the stacked bars and adopt line and pie charts for a clearer representation of market trends, focusing on major brands like Volkswagen, BYD, and Tesla for a comprehensive market overview because they are from Europe, the US, and China. This visualization is aimed at marketing managers and investors, who require accurate and accessible data to inform strategic decisions and investment allocations in the automotive sector.

This is the original data visualization:

# Sketch Out a Solution 
Here are some of my sketches about the Global Electronic Vehicle. 
For this Bar graph, I use Blue for Volkswagen, Red for Tesla and Yellow for BYD, I also place the major share leader on the top of the bar.

Here is the line graph I plotted with the same color scheme. The x-axis is the Quarters and the y-axis is the percentage.

Here is the Pie Chart I created follow the same color scheme and representing only one of the quarters.

# Test Out the Solution
I conducted three short interviews to ask people for their feedback on my redesigned and newly created data visualization on global market share of electronic vehicles. The questions for them mainly focused on their intuitive first-look understanding of the data, some interpretation of the audience, and suggestions for changes. 

22 Female Student

- what do you think this is?
  I think they all show the market share of Tesla, BYD and Volkswagen in global e-vehicle

- Would you describe to me what this is telling you?
  Tesla has always been doing well until recently getting surpassed by BYD. Volkswagen is not comparable with these two big leaders
  BYD's been growing fast
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who is the intended audience for this, in your opinion?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
