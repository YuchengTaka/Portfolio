Here is the link to my shorthand preview page: https://preview.shorthand.com/J962V2jfnGTVD7I3

Introduction Slide: A background knowledge on the topic This sets the tone for the contrast you'll explore.
Problem Statement: A clear, concise visualization illustrating the growth of digital music streaming services over time, accompanied by rising energy consumption. Use icons and brief text to make the issue immediately clear.
Data Visualization Drafts:
A bar chart comparing the energy consumption of digital vs. physical music formats over the past decade.
A line graph showing the rise in carbon emissions attributed to the data centers powering music streaming services.
A stacked bar graph illustrating the market share of digital versus physical music sales year over year, highlighting the shift toward digital.

# User research 

## Target audience


Young adults aged 18-35 frequently use digital music streaming services and express some concern about environmental issues. 

## Identify individuals to Review
Ideally, I could conduct a survey on campus to ask CMU and UPitts students about their opinions on the shorthand delivery. I could also advocate my interviewer to help me find other people they knew who fit in my target audience. 

## Interview Goals & Questions

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|   Collect understanding of the topic from the audience |    What can you observe about how people enjoy music these days?               |
|   Did I convey the emotion and attention I want?    | After hearing about the potential environmental costs, does this change how you feel about streaming music?                 |
|   Check engagement   |   Do you feel fatigue or uncomfortable when browsing over my content               |
|   Ask advise for content   |      What do you think I could ask to call for action in this scenario            |

> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

The interview and group discussion for part 2 have been very constructive in giving me directions to move forward to part 3. The others' perspective helped me find out the blemishes and mistakes I made while designing my story delivery.  I am still clearing my data to generate the ideal data visualization I wanted but the progress is very promising
